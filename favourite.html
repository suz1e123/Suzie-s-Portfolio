      <h1>My Favourite Things About Web Development</h1>
     <p>
        One of my absolute favourite stages of web-development is when we got 
        to use Wix studio and design sites because it was enjoyable and I loved to use 
        different features to put on my wesite design.

        Another of my favourites things to do was design web pages on Figma.
        I thought this was very fun and easy to do, it was fun to choose the 
        colors that I wanted and could customize anything to my likings.
